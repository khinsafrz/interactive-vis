From Numbers to Narratives: Exploring Stories Through Interactive Visualisation
Interactive Visualisation Project
Khinsa Fairuz Zahirah (Fai) - Jen - Richard - Georgia

A series of charts to be used by Kaggle as part of a series of blog posts and social media content regarding employment within the data science industry.
We aimed to create charts that work together as part of this professional application, whilst remaining functional and informative as stand-alone charts.

The project is conducted on Visual Studio Code.
The project is using html and javascript, with d3js as the main library.
The raw and cleaned data are in excel files, the final data used in VSCode are json files.
The main web solution is in the Web Solution Files folder.
There are prototypes and other interesting stuffs in separate folders.

Thanks!
